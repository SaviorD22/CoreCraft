# CoreCraft Config

This Github Repository contains the recommended settings for CoreCraft.

** Server Files

Start OPT has 8GB of ram reserved for CoreCraft and has many Java arguments to optimize it, but its recommended to use an Oracle Enterprise version of Java 17 in order to safely use the script.

For Server.properties we recommend changing network-compression-treshold from 256 to 64, note that you may want to do this only if you have low bandwith and a moderate CPU, in the case you have the contrary leave the default value.
