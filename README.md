# CoreCraft Config

This Github Repository contains the recommended settings for CoreCraft.

**Server Files**

Start OPT has 8GB of RAM reserved for CoreCraft (can be changed) and has many Java arguments to optimize it, but it is recommended to use an Oracle Enterprise version of Java 17 in order to safely use the script.  To get Java head to releases and for the scripts download the code as zip :)

For Server.properties we recommend changing network-compression-threshold from 256 to 64, note that you may want to do this only if you have low bandwidth and a moderate CPU, in the case you have the contrary leave the default value.
